The **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree** program includes improving programming skills and ability to work with messy and complex data sets. You can learn to manage data, prepare it for analysis and create visualizations for data exploration. Apply visualization principles to the data analysis process and explore data visually at multiple levels to find ideas and create a compelling story.

### Final projects after each part of the program: ###  

**[Exploring Weather Trends](P1_Explore_Weather_Trends/Weather_Trends_Litvinova.pdf)**   
In this project, we need to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in studentâ€™s local area (in my case, this is Amsterdam) with the general global temperature trends.

**[Investigate TMDb movie data](P2_Investigate_TMDb_Movie_Data/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)**   
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. 
In this project, we need to analyze a dataset and then share our findings about it. NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib Python libraries are used in the project to simplify analysis.

**[Analyze A/B Test Results](P3_Analyze_AB_Test_Results/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb)**   
The company developed a new web page to try to increase the number of users who "convert", that is, the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
In this project, we work to understand the results of an A / B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand whether to implement this new page, keep the old one, or perhaps run the experiment for a longer period before making a decision.   

**[Wrangle and Analyze Data](P4_Wrangle_And_Analyze_Data/wrangle_act.ipynb)**   
The dataset that we wrangled (as well as analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of the Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. Our goal is to process WeRateDogs tweet data to create interesting and reliable analysis and visualizations.   
**A summary of data processing for this project can be viewed here:**   
[Wrangle report](P4_Wrangle_And_Analyze_Data/wrangle_report.pdf) - briefly describes our wrangling efforts.   
[Act report](P4_Wrangle_And_Analyze_Data/act_report.pdf) - communicates especially interesting insights and displays visualizations produced from our wrangled data.

**[Communicate Data Findings](P5_Communicate_Data_Findings/exploration_dataset_Ford_GoBike.ipynb)**   
The dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system in February, 2019. The total amount of data items (rides) in the dataset after cleaning all incorrect data is 174952. The data for this dataset was downloaded from Udacity. In this analysis, the main interest is the data associated with the user, as well as the features associated with the movement of the users. I find it useful for business to have information about the most popular stations, user routes and the hours and days of the week when users are most active in rental.
